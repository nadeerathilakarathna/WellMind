**Introduction** <br>
The modern IT industry is associated with high workloads, tight deadlines, and demanding schedules. <br>
These conditions significantly contribute to elevated stress levels among IT professionals. <br>
"WellMind" is an AI-powered stress detection system designed to monitor and improve workplace mental health. <br>
It uses facial expressions and keystroke dynamics to detect the stress and provide recommendations through interactive avatar. <br>
The system aims to create a healthier and more productive work environment. <br>

**System Features** <br>
Facial Expression Monitoring <br>
Keystroke Dynamics Analysis <br>
Multimodal Stress Detection <br>
Real-Time Stress Feedback <br>
Preference Management <br>
Personalized Recommendation Engine <br>
Historical Stress Visualization <br>
Interactive Avatar Support <br>
Local Data Storage <br>

**Functional Requirements** <br>
FR1 - The system shall capture facial expressions via the device's webcam. <br>
FR2 - The system shall analyze facial expressions using AI models to detect stress. <br>
FR3 - The system shall capture keystroke dynamics from the device's keyboard. <br>
FR4 - The system shall analyze keystroke dynamics using AI models to detect stress. <br>
FR5 - The system shall integrate facial expression and keystroke analyses for multimodal stress detection. <br>
FR6 - The system shall allow the user to provide feedback on system recommendations by marking them as “Like” or “Unlike” via the interactive avatar. <br>
FR7 - The system shall allow users to change their recommendation categories. <br>
FR8 - The system shall recommend activities or content types based on detected stress levels and preferences. <br>
FR9 - The system shall use stored data to generate personalized recommendations over time. <br>
FR10 - The system shall display a historical stress graph on the user dashboard. <br>
FR11 - The system shall feature an interactive avatar to provide feedback and suggestions to the user. <br>
FR12 - The system shall animate the avatar based on user interactions (e.g., mouse, keyboard) and system events (e.g., USB plugged). <br>
FR13 - The system shall store user profiles locally, including past stress levels, history, and preferences. <br>

**Non Functional Requirements** <br>
